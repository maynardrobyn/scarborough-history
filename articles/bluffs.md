The Scarborough Bluffs are an imposing feature at the edge of Lake Ontario: prominent, soft, sandy cliffs prone to erosion, but perhaps the most impressive topography to be found in theToronto metroplitan area. In fact, Scarborough owes its English-language name to the cliffs, which Lady Simcoe imagined bore a resemblance to the cliffs of Scarborough, England.  Of course, their history extends much further back in time; uncovering and escribing the pre-settlement history of the bluffs region is an exercise I leave to the audience.
